If so, please limit the above requirements to only be valid for the identified ticket.\r\n\r\nThis is possible because there is access to the car's status as well as the ticket number while the car is not ACTIVE.\r\n\r\n(Here's what the \"Limited Reason\" and \"Exit Reason\" should look like, at the bottom left of a Zendesk ticket -- this is not for us to implement.
